If you want to share with people on your local network:

python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 0.0.0.0

# Find your IP address
ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
```

## Current Status

âœ… **GitHub Pages workflow configured** - Your site will automatically deploy when you push changes to the main branch.

## Next Steps

1. **Enable GitHub Pages** in your repository settings
2. **Share the URL** with others once deployed
3. **Monitor deployments** in the Actions tab of your GitHub repository

## Troubleshooting

- If GitHub Pages doesn't work, check the Actions tab for deployment errors
- Make sure your repository is public (or you have GitHub Pro for private repos)
- Verify that the gh-pages branch was created after the first deployment
